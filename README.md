# LIFTNOTEBOOK

This is a microservice based project with the following components:

1. exerciselib -> maps different movement patterns to a target muscle, categorizing in compound or isolated.
2. libconsole -> this is a frontend app that allows an admin user to modify / interact with exerciselib
3. liftnotebook -> workout tracker (TODO)
